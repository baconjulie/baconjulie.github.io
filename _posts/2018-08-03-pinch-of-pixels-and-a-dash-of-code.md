## The Girl Behind the Code

Hi üëã I‚Äôm Julie Bacon and I build things on the Internet. I work in the tech industry in building best-in-class web applications for everything from Fortune 500 companies to startups to nonprofits. Every day I get to design and develop solutions to problems where I am only limited by my own creativity. If I see something I don‚Äôt like in the world, I have the tools and power to try to change it, from anywhere in the world. In my opinion, there is nothing more inspiring than this.

After talking to lots of coding beginners and friends who see tech as frustrating or intimidating, I decided to build this blog to share my experiences with tech at the intersection of work, life, health, and finance. Pinch of Pixels is a tech and lifestyle blog that helps make tech more accessible, useful and relatable.

### Tech IRL

I also use technology to enhance my overall quality of life -- from my physical and mental health, finances, career, and relationships -- tech inevitably fits into all of this. This blog covers how you can leverage technology to enhance your life (including when tech has overstayed its welcome ‚úåÔ∏è).

### Do I have to be a Coder?

From code tutorials, to what‚Äôs trending, to why you can‚Äôt stop checking your god damn instagram feed, Pinch of Pixels is that friend you go to for all your tech related questions. Except no, we won‚Äôt fix your broken printer, sry.

Whether you‚Äôre a code newbie looking to launch a new career or just looking for tips on how tech can work for you and your lifestyle, you can always defer to your Pinch of Pixels friend for the juice.
