## The Girl Behind the Code

Hi World üëã I‚Äôm [Julie Bacon](/about) and I build things on the Internet. I work in the tech industry building best-in-class web applications for Fortune500 companies to startups to nonprofits. I fell into coding by accident when I was 11 years old playing Neopets and making my Myspace layouts against my mother's wishes. The Internet was so exciting back then, and it continues to excite and inspire me years later. I went on to study Computer Science at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/computer-science/people/julie-bacon.html), and pursue a career in Front-End development.

### Technology, in Code Form
Every day I get to design and develop solutions to problems where I am only limited by my own creativity. If I see something I don‚Äôt like in the world, I have the tools and power to try to change it. If I see something that I wish existed in the world, I have the tools and power to create it. In my opinion, there is nothing more exciting than using technology as an instrument of change.

### Technology, but IRL
I also use technology to enhance my overall quality of life -- from my physical and mental health, finances, career, and relationships -- tech inevitably fits into all of this. This blog covers how you can leverage technology to enhance your life (including when tech has overstayed its welcome ‚úåÔ∏è).

### Why this blog
After talking to coding beginners and friends who see tech as frustrating or intimidating, I decided to build this blog to share my experiences with tech at the intersection of work, life, health, and finance. Pinch of Pixels is a tech and lifestyle blog that helps make tech more accessible, useful and relatable.

From code tutorials, to what‚Äôs trending, to why you can‚Äôt stop checking your goddamn Instagram feed, Pinch of Pixels is that friend you go to for all your tech related questions. Except no, we won‚Äôt fix your broken printer, sry.

Whether you‚Äôre a code newbie looking to launch a new career or just looking for tips on how tech can work for you and your lifestyle, you can always defer to a Pinch of Pixels (and a dash of code). And emojis. So. Many. Emojis.
