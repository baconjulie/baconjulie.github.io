## Celebratory Hacking ü•Ç

When I think of the term ‚Äúhacking‚Äù I think of using tech as a force for good. I think of using technology and creativity to solve problems and build cool things. I most definitely don‚Äôt think of the stereotypical dude in his mom‚Äôs basement in a grey hoodie... sorry Hollywood üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.

We‚Äôre about to take hacking to a whole new level, I call it celebratory hacking! Are you about to get married? Celebrating 10 years of friendship with your best friend? Throwing an 75th birthday party for your grandma? Whatever the big occassion, Americans spend hundreds on personalized services.

Companies that do personalized party decorations like will likely cost you an [arm and a leg](https://www.forbes.com/sites/discoverpersonalloans/2017/08/10/the-cost-of-todays-wedding-trends-5-takeaways-from-the-knots-real-weddings-survey/#1b2e562f7b50) (thanks wedding industrial complex) so I thought, why not make them yourself?

## Save Your Money

When my brother and his fiance were planning their wedding in California, I jumped at the opportunity to help with some of the design work. They decided on coasters as a party favor, cute table signs for the gift, dessert, and guest book tables, and the quintessential snapchat filter. My jaw dropped when my future sister-in-law said that a Snapchat filter was going to cost them roughly $150. I was able to make one for only $23.

So whatever it is you‚Äôre celebrating, roll up your sleeves and get ready to get a lil crafty and a lil hacky.

## 1. Custom Coasters
1. Find a few cute, free fonts for the typography on your decorations. Check out fonts on [dafont](https://www.dafont.com/) and [1001 fonts](https://www.1001fonts.com/).
2. Download the font files.
3. For Mac users, open [Font Book](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-install-fonts-on-a-mac/) for Windows users, launch your [Font Manager](https://www.fontspring.com/support/how-do-i-install-fonts-on-my-windows-pc).
4. Drag the font files into your font book / manager.
5. Choose your editing program of choice (I use [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)).
6. Choose a wholesale coaster printer (I ordered through [this supplier](https://www.4imprint.com/product/131166/Small-Cork-Coaster-Circle) and their customer service was üíØ)
7. Download the supplie's template file, if they have one, open in Photoshop.
8. Design to your hearts content.
9. Upload the file to the supplier and place your order.

## 2. Custom Table Signs
1. We‚Äôve already got our sick fonts from earlier
2. Open photoshop, new document the size of computer paper (I did 8 x 10)
3. Type in those fancy words
4. Choose a printing service i.e. Print at Home, Home Depot, Office Max
5. Place your order, get cheap frames from the dollar store, done!

## 3. Custom Snapchat Filter
1. Go to [Snapchat](https://www.snapchat.com/create)
2. Double, Triple, Quadrouple check the event location and time!! You don' want to f*ck this up.
3. Choose from a pre-designed filter or opt to make your own from their template file in Photoshop. You can add custom text, illustrations, etc.
4. Enter the time and date for the event.
5. Create a _Geofence_. Draw the perimeter for where you‚Äôd like the filter to apply on the map. Snapchat will use the coordinates for this geolocation to only display this filter within that range. Don‚Äôt f*ck this up!!
6. Submit for approval üòé
